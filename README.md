# SportStore
This is a Swift 2 implementation of the code examples in Adam Freeman's "Pro Design Patterns in Swift".

Many of the patterns in the book have small typos or are completely broken using Swift 2 syntax requirements.  This code updates all the examples related to the central SportsStore application.
